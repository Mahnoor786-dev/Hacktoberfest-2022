## WHAT TO CONTRIBUTE ?
   1. Help me build a repository for the BEST SOLUTIONS of COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING questions.
   2. Have you ever solved a competitive programming question? Add its solution with problem statement or reference to source. Example: leetcode problem number or hackerrank problem code etc.. Make sure it must be a correct and efficient solution.
   3. It can be in any programming language. What matters is, it should be useful.
   
## GUIDELINES BEFORE YOU START CONTRIBUTING:
   1. I will not merge basic programming questions like hello world etc. Only COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING questions are accepted with proper reference to problem.
   2. QUANTITY IS FUN, QUALITY IS KEY. So, focus on quality contribution
   3. Don't contribute spam. I will not merge it and it will not benefit you in the long term
   4. Contribute to help community not just for swags

# STEP BY STEP GUIDE TO HACKTOBERFEST PULL REQUEST:

## 1. Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## 2. Clone the repository

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/this-is-you/first-contributions.git
```

where `this-is-you` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the first-contributions repository on GitHub to your computer.

## 3. Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd first-contributions
```

Now create a branch using the `git switch` command:

```
git switch -c your-new-branch-name
```

For example:

```
git switch -c branch-name
```

## 4. Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add name of file-you-added
OR
git add .  //to add all files
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "meaningful commit message indicating what you have added or updated"
```


## 5. Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push origin -u your-branch-name
```

replacing `your-branch-name` with the name of the branch you created earlier.


## 6. Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.
